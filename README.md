THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING ROAD TO ELDORADO VERSION 0.1!

The .exe is not a virus, and my project does not contain malware. 
This seems to be a very common problem with pyinstaller/.exe files, with few solutions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64788656/exe-file-made-with-pyinstaller-being-reported-as-a-virus-threat-by-windows-defen

NOTES: 

This will most likely the final version of this project. The purpose of this project was learning the basics of python.
I completed the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLeplbqtqg 
And then continued to develop the program: 
  - I organized the code into separate files, 
  - and added mutiple features:
      - sprint
      - character selection
      - level selection
      - user settings
      - multiple levels
      - vertical scrolling
      - etc.

There are still a few bugs and issues with collision, lack of try statements, and lack of proper levels/objects. 
However, the game runs well and the code is clean.
